		encodes the inputted string with the entered shift value and returns the encoded message.
		you may also use a negative value key with this option to decode, however it is not recommended.

	-t,
		unit test mode, to ensure program is functioning correctly

	should be encompassed by quotation marks to ensure the program completes without error.
	If the string contains no spaces this can be ignored
